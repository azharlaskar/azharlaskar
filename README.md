- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @azharlaskar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and deep learning techniques, primarily, in the field of Speech Technology. I have experience working with speaker and language recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing techniques. Iâ€™m currently learning more about representation learning and working towards developing various speech-based applications that may help to facilitate man in its day-to-day interaction with the digital world.
